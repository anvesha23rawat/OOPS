Practical No. 8

Anna is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know 
how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the exams given during
this semester. Create a class named Student with the following specifications:
Ø An instance variable named scores holds a student's 5 exam scores.
Ø A void input () function reads 5 integers and saves them to scores.
Ø An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores.

Source Code:
